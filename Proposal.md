### MVP
AAU I should be able to sign up and sign in to a secure web app to create diaries.
AAU I should be able to read, update and delete the diaries I have created.
AAU I should be able to sign out of my profile.


# Stretch goal 
AAU I should be able to organize my diaries into categories



# Pseudocode:
1: create a home page where users will be able to sign up and sign in to the web app
2: creata a page displaying option to create a diary  and access created diaries
3: create a page allowing users to update or delete their diaries
4: have a sign out button allowing users to exit their account 




```javascript 

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const diarySchema = mongoose.Schema({
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  journal: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
  },
});

const userSchema = mongoose.Schema({
  username: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  diaries: [diarySchema], 
});


const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

module.exports = User;
